### About
This is a personal website hosted on `github pages` to documentate my ongoing/finished projects, notes, images and such.

The website is created with `mkDocs` using modified `material` theme. Images and videos are 
hosted on `imgur`.

## Site layout
````bash
docs/
    Links/      # Links that I find useful sometimes
    Notes/      # Various notes I have written or copy-pasted from somewhere
    Projects/   # Personal projects ( finished and unfinished, old and new )
    ...
