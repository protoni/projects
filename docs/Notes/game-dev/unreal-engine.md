##### Console
````bash
# Setup editor console
Edit -> Editor settings -> Keyboard Shortcuts -> search for 'console'
-> Set keybind for 'Open console command box' ( for example '§' )

# Setup in game console
Edit -> Project settings -> Input -> Console -> Set Console key ( for example 'ยง' )

# Console settings
Edit -> Project settings -> Console

## Console commands:
# Set fps to max 60
t.maxFPS 60

# Show fps
stat FPS

# Show triangle count
stat RHI

# Displays the amount of time in milliseconds used by the GPU for different processes. 
Stat GPU

##### C++
````bash
# UPROPERTY
- Step 1: Determine blueprint accessibility
  - BlueprintReadWrite: Blueprints can read and write the variable
  - BlueprintReadOnly: Blueprints can only read the variable
  - <nothing>: Can be left empty, new variables should always have at least empty UPROPERTY

- Step 2: Determine editor accessibility
  - EditAnywhere
  - EditInstanceOnly
  - EditDefaultsOnly
  - VisibleAnywhere
  - VisibleInstanceOnly
  - VisibleDefaultsOnly
  - <nothing>
  
- Step 3: Determine category
  - Add Category = "_name_here_"-parameter

- Step 4:
  - Meta = (AllowPrivateAccess = "true"): fix compiler error saying that "VisibleAnywhere" can't be a private variable

# UFUNCTION
- Step 1: Determine blueprint accessibility
  - BlueprintCallable: Use for non const functions
  - BlueprintPure: Use for const functions
  - <nothing>: Can be left empty, new functions should always have at least empty UFUNCTION

- Step 2: Determine implementation location
  - BlueprintImplementableEvent: Can have function body only in blueprints
  - BlueprintNativeEvent: Can have function body both in blueprints and c++

- Step 3: Determine category
  - Add Category = "_name_here_"-parameter


# Note! If C++ -> Blueprint functions act weird; restart UE4 and re-parent the object by opening the blueprint, change parent in details panel to the main parent and then back to base parent

# When creating a new project, start with a blueprint project. Can be changed
later to C++ project.
