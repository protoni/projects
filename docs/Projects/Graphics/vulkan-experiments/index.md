### Description
I have been following this Udemy course on Vulkan API and managed to get something to the screen finally
after about 11 hours worth of lessons. 

A triangle:

It's a pretty low level graphics API, the triangle required around 1.2k lines of code + headers.

Vulkan is very verbose and alot of code is required to set it up initially. Big portion of the code is just 
filling structure types with a bunch of settings for the Vulkan.

I also got into learning OpenGL a while back and for reference the amount of code required to draw a triangle to the screen
was around 170 lines.

This is still pretty interesting, will see how long can this hold my interest.
