
## Description
I created this Unreal Engine scene during my summer vacation a few months ago. 
It took about a week for me to create as I haven't worked on Unreal Engine in a while.

Originally I wanted to just import my custom 3D model and move it around, but kept adding
new features in there.

The character is a custom 3D model created in Blender.

## Features
It is entirely a Blueprint based implementation, with a few features:
```bash
- day/night cycle handling
- settings menu to adjust the day/night cycle and control sound effects
- ground type based footstep sounds
- interactable foliage that plays sounds when the player runs over it.
- player character with WASD + jump keys and animations.
- ambiance sound
```

## Movement keys
3D model imported and movement keys added

## Trees
Some trees added to the scene. They seem to align to terrain face normals, which I changed
later on.

## Footstep sounds
Footstep sounds based on the ground type. So grass/ground sounds.

Also seems that there are god rays in there as a lighting effect. Can't remember if I
 explicitly added them or does UE just automatically enable them with directional lights.
